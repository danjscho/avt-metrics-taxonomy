# Part D — Impact & Outcomes

## Patient Experience

*Direct impact on the individual patient: consent, disclosure, therapeutic relationship.*

**Tier breakdown**: 🟢 1 Tier 1 · 🔵 5 Tier 3

### 🟢 Patient Opt-Out Rate

Percentage declining AVT. Disaggregate by demographics to reveal equity issues in consent model.

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Priority Tier** | 🟢 Tier 1 — Minimum Viable |
| **Measurement Cadence** | Continuous |
| **Pipeline Layer** | Cross-cutting |
| **Assurance Question** | Patient Experience |
| **Measurement Method** | Passive Observational |
| **Lifecycle Phases** | Continuous |
| **Responsible Actors** | Deployer |
| **Maturity** | Established |
| **Outcome Type** | Proximal |
| **Source** | NAS SPI; CQC Mythbuster 109 |

**Why this tier?**

> Deployer-measurable from practice records. Low-burden continuous monitoring. Rising rates signal trust issues. Demographic disaggregation reveals consent model equity.

**Formal Definition**

```
OOR = |P_optout| / |P_offered|. χ² test for independence between opt-out and demographic group. Significant association = inequitable consent model.
```

**References**

- **CQC**: Mythbuster 109: implied consent sufficient but patients must be informed

**Limitations**

> Low opt-out ≠ informed consent.

**Novel Thinking / Implications**

> 💡 Higher opt-out in specific demographics = equity issue in consent model, not just preference.

### 🔵 Patient-Perceived Accuracy

When patients are shown their AVT-generated notes, do they recognise the consultation? Distinct from clinician-judged accuracy — patients may identify omissions or distortions that clinicians miss because they were the speakers.

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Priority Tier** | 🔵 Tier 3 — Advanced / Research |
| **Measurement Cadence** | Periodic audit |
| **Pipeline Layer** | Cross-cutting |
| **Assurance Question** | Patient Experience |
| **Measurement Method** | Survey |
| **Lifecycle Phases** | Periodic Audit |
| **Responsible Actors** | Deployer, Academic |
| **Maturity** | Proposed / Novel |
| **Outcome Type** | Distal |
| **Source** | Patient-centred care evaluation methodology |

**Why this tier?**

> Important but resource-intensive. Best suited for periodic structured study rather than routine measurement.

**Formal Definition**

```
Patient survey after note generation: 'Does this note accurately reflect our conversation?' (5-point Likert, plus free-text comments). Accuracy Rate = proportion answering 'accurate' or 'very accurate'. Comments analysed for systematic complaint patterns.
```

**Limitations**

> Requires patient access to notes and willingness to provide feedback. Patient understanding of clinical documentation conventions varies.

**Novel Thinking / Implications**

> 💡 Patients are the only assessor who knows what was actually said in the consultation from their own perspective. They notice when their concerns were minimised, when the clinician's interpretation differs from their own, and when emotional content was stripped. With patient access to records becoming standard (NHS App), patient-perceived accuracy is increasingly important for trust in the clinical record.

### 🔵 Emotional Content Preservation

Does the note capture the patient's emotional state when clinically relevant? AVT systems trained on standard clinical notes may strip affective content that matters for mental health, end-of-life care, safeguarding, and complex consultations.

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Priority Tier** | 🔵 Tier 3 — Advanced / Research |
| **Measurement Cadence** | Periodic audit |
| **Pipeline Layer** | Summarisation |
| **Assurance Question** | Patient Experience |
| **Measurement Method** | Human Review |
| **Lifecycle Phases** | Periodic Audit |
| **Responsible Actors** | Deployer, Academic |
| **Maturity** | Proposed / Novel |
| **Outcome Type** | Distal |
| **Source** | Identified gap in clinical AI evaluation — affective content is systematically deprioritised |

**Why this tier?**

> Critical for specific clinical contexts (mental health, palliative care, safeguarding) but not universally applicable.

**Formal Definition**

```
For consultations involving emotional content (annotated): proportion of clinically relevant emotional markers preserved in summary. Categories: distress, grief, fear, ambivalence, hope. Required for: mental health, end-of-life, safeguarding, life-limiting illness consultations.
```

**Limitations**

> Emotional content annotation is subjective. Different clinical contexts have different requirements for affective documentation.

**Novel Thinking / Implications**

> 💡 AVT systems trained on standard primary care notes have learned that emotional content is rarely documented. When deployed in mental health, palliative care, or safeguarding contexts, this learned behaviour becomes a serious gap. The patient who said 'I just don't know how I'll cope' deserves to have that documented — but the AI may strip it as non-clinical content.

### 🔵 Cultural & Linguistic Appropriateness

Does the note use language that respects the patient's cultural and linguistic context? Important for shared records that patients can access. Includes avoiding stigmatising language and respecting how patients describe their own conditions.

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Priority Tier** | 🔵 Tier 3 — Advanced / Research |
| **Measurement Cadence** | Periodic audit |
| **Pipeline Layer** | Summarisation |
| **Assurance Question** | Patient Experience |
| **Measurement Method** | Human Review |
| **Lifecycle Phases** | Periodic Audit |
| **Responsible Actors** | Deployer, Academic |
| **Maturity** | Proposed / Novel |
| **Outcome Type** | Distal |
| **Source** | Patient-centred care literature; growing concern with patient access to records |

**Why this tier?**

> Important quality dimension but requires structured audit by appropriate reviewers.

**Formal Definition**

```
Audit for: (1) stigmatising language ('drug-seeking', 'non-compliant', 'frequent flyer'); (2) cultural assumptions; (3) translation of patient's own terms into clinical jargon when patient access is enabled. Proportion of notes flagged in audit.
```

**Limitations**

> Cultural appropriateness is highly context-dependent. Audit requires diverse reviewers.

**Novel Thinking / Implications**

> 💡 AVT systems trained on legacy clinical notes may perpetuate language patterns that are inappropriate when patients can read their own records. The language that was acceptable when notes were clinician-only is sometimes unacceptable when notes are shared. This is a quiet failure mode — the AI is faithfully reproducing patterns from its training data that need to change.

### 🔵 Chilling Effect Assessment

Whether AVT suppresses sensitive disclosures. Most under-researched risk — population-level safety issue if record becomes systematically biased.

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Priority Tier** | 🔵 Tier 3 — Advanced / Research |
| **Measurement Cadence** | Periodic audit |
| **Pipeline Layer** | Cross-cutting |
| **Assurance Question** | Patient Experience |
| **Measurement Method** | Survey |
| **Lifecycle Phases** | Periodic Audit |
| **Responsible Actors** | Deployer, Academic |
| **Maturity** | Proposed / Novel |
| **Outcome Type** | Distal |
| **Source** | NHSE LLM framework gap analysis |

**Why this tier?**

> The most under-researched AVT risk but extremely difficult to measure — detecting information that wasn't shared. Requires carefully designed qualitative research.

**Formal Definition**

```
Disclosure Rate Ratio DRR = DR_AVT / DR_noAVT for sensitive categories (mental health, substance use, sexual health, domestic abuse). DRR < 1.0 = chilling effect. Mixed-methods: quantitative + qualitative.
```

**Limitations**

> Detecting information not shared requires careful qualitative research.

**Novel Thinking / Implications**

> 💡 If AVT suppresses sensitive disclosures, the record becomes systematically biased — missing exactly the information that matters most.

### 🔵 Therapeutic Relationship Impact

How AVT affects consultation quality. Net impact depends on whether review is in-consultation or post-consultation.

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Priority Tier** | 🔵 Tier 3 — Advanced / Research |
| **Measurement Cadence** | Periodic audit |
| **Pipeline Layer** | Cross-cutting |
| **Assurance Question** | Patient Experience |
| **Measurement Method** | Survey |
| **Lifecycle Phases** | Periodic Audit |
| **Responsible Actors** | Deployer, Academic |
| **Maturity** | Proposed / Novel |
| **Outcome Type** | Distal |
| **Source** | Consultation quality literature |

**Why this tier?**

> Subjective, context-dependent. Positive novelty effect masks longer-term changes. Research priority but not routine deployer measurement.

**Formal Definition**

```
Multi-dimensional: (1) PCQ-18 adapted; (2) Clinician engagement scale; (3) Eye contact ratio; (4) Consultation duration. Pre/post crossover design.
```

**Limitations**

> Novelty effect may mask long-term changes.

**Novel Thinking / Implications**

> 💡 Marketed as freeing clinicians, but review-before-signing creates new post-consultation task. Workflow design determines the outcome.
