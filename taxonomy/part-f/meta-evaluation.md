# Part F — Evaluation Science

## Meta-evaluation

*Are we measuring what matters? Structural critique of proximal vs distal outcomes and evaluation science itself.*

**Tier breakdown**: 🟡 1 Tier 2 · 🔵 4 Tier 3

### 🔵 Proximal vs Distal Outcome Distinction

The most important structural critique: measuring easy things and assuming they correlate with hard things. Require causal logic models.

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Priority Tier** | 🔵 Tier 3 — Advanced / Research |
| **Measurement Cadence** | Periodic audit |
| **Pipeline Layer** | Cross-cutting |
| **Assurance Question** | Meta-evaluation |
| **Measurement Method** | Hybrid |
| **Lifecycle Phases** | Periodic Audit |
| **Responsible Actors** | National Body, Academic |
| **Maturity** | Emerging |
| **Outcome Type** | Distal |
| **Source** | Coiera & Fraile-Navarro 2026; NIHR RSET |

**Why this tier?**

> Structural critique of the evaluation field. Not a metric to implement but a framework for assessing all other metrics. National/academic responsibility.

**Formal Definition**

```
Proximal P = {WER, edit_rate, doc_time}. Distal D = {safety events, care quality, patient outcomes}. For each pᵢ, require causal model: pᵢ → [mechanism] → dⱼ with evidence. Burden on vendors/deployers to demonstrate P→D.
```

**Limitations**

> Distal outcomes slow to manifest, hard to attribute.

**Novel Thinking / Implications**

> 💡 National evaluation standard should require explicit causal logic models with burden of proof on vendors.

### 🔵 Inter-Rater Reliability Baseline

Clinician agreement ceiling. VeriFact exceeds it (92.7% vs 88.5%). When automated metrics beat humans, what does that mean?

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Priority Tier** | 🔵 Tier 3 — Advanced / Research |
| **Measurement Cadence** | One-off gate |
| **Pipeline Layer** | Cross-cutting |
| **Assurance Question** | Meta-evaluation |
| **Measurement Method** | Human Review |
| **Lifecycle Phases** | Pre-deployment |
| **Responsible Actors** | Academic |
| **Maturity** | Established |
| **Outcome Type** | Proximal |
| **Source** | VeriFact; MedHELM |

**Why this tier?**

> Research calibration baseline. Essential for interpreting automated metrics but an academic activity, not a deployer responsibility.

**Formal Definition**

```
Cohen's κ (k=2) or Fleiss' κ (k>2). ICC(2,1) for continuous ratings. VeriFact: 92.7% vs 88.5% inter-clinician. MedHELM: ICC 0.47 vs 0.43.
```

**Limitations**

> Clinicians don't agree with each other. Any metric inherits this ceiling.

**Novel Thinking / Implications**

> 💡 When automated metric exceeds inter-clinician agreement: better than humans, or systematically biased in a correlated way?

### 🔵 Metric Interaction Analysis

Do the metrics in the taxonomy correlate or conflict? A system optimised for low edit rate might achieve it through over-summarisation that increases omission rate. Multi-metric monitoring requires understanding interactions.

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Priority Tier** | 🔵 Tier 3 — Advanced / Research |
| **Measurement Cadence** | Periodic audit |
| **Pipeline Layer** | Cross-cutting |
| **Assurance Question** | Meta-evaluation |
| **Measurement Method** | Computational |
| **Lifecycle Phases** | Periodic Audit |
| **Responsible Actors** | National Body, Academic |
| **Maturity** | Proposed / Novel |
| **Outcome Type** | Distal |
| **Source** | Multi-metric evaluation literature |

**Why this tier?**

> Research-grade meta-analysis. National body responsibility.

**Formal Definition**

```
For each pair of metrics (m1, m2): compute correlation across deployments. Identify: (1) reinforcing pairs (improving both); (2) trade-off pairs (optimising one degrades the other); (3) confounded pairs (apparent correlation but distinct causes).
```

**Limitations**

> Requires data across multiple deployments to identify systematic interactions. Single-deployer analysis is underpowered.

**Novel Thinking / Implications**

> 💡 Without interaction analysis, governance can drive perverse outcomes. A practice told to reduce edit rate might pressure clinicians to edit less — but the AI hasn't improved, so the underlying error rate is unchanged. Edit rate goes down, hallucination rate goes up. This is the kind of failure that interaction analysis catches.

### 🟡 Goodhart's Law Monitoring

When a metric becomes a target, does it cease to be a good measure? Specifically tracking whether metrics are being gamed — optimised in ways that satisfy the metric without achieving the underlying goal.

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Priority Tier** | 🟡 Tier 2 — Recommended |
| **Measurement Cadence** | Periodic audit |
| **Pipeline Layer** | Cross-cutting |
| **Assurance Question** | Meta-evaluation |
| **Measurement Method** | Human Review |
| **Lifecycle Phases** | Periodic Audit |
| **Responsible Actors** | Deployer, Regional (ICB) |
| **Maturity** | Proposed / Novel |
| **Outcome Type** | Distal |
| **Source** | Goodhart's Law applied to clinical AI metrics |

**Why this tier?**

> Important meta-governance check. Should be part of periodic audit to ensure metrics remain meaningful.

**Formal Definition**

```
For each Tier 1 metric: identify gaming strategies that could satisfy the metric without improving safety. Audit for evidence of gaming. Examples: edit rate gaming via no-op edits; review-before-signing gaming via auto-scroll; opt-out gaming via not informing patients.
```

**Limitations**

> Gaming detection is itself a research problem. Sophisticated gaming may be undetectable.

**Novel Thinking / Implications**

> 💡 Every metric in this taxonomy is potentially gameable. Edit rate can be gamed by trivial edits. Review-before-signing can be gamed by auto-scrolling. The question isn't whether gaming will happen but whether the governance framework detects and addresses it. Periodic audit should specifically look for gaming patterns, not just metric values.

### 🔵 Coverage Gap Analysis

What failure modes are not captured by any metric in the taxonomy? Periodic review of incidents to identify metric blindspots. The taxonomy itself must evolve as new failure modes emerge.

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Priority Tier** | 🔵 Tier 3 — Advanced / Research |
| **Measurement Cadence** | Periodic audit |
| **Pipeline Layer** | Cross-cutting |
| **Assurance Question** | Meta-evaluation |
| **Measurement Method** | Human Review |
| **Lifecycle Phases** | Periodic Audit |
| **Responsible Actors** | National Body, Academic |
| **Maturity** | Proposed / Novel |
| **Outcome Type** | Distal |
| **Source** | Standard safety engineering coverage analysis |

**Why this tier?**

> Meta-governance responsibility. National body should maintain the taxonomy as new failure modes emerge.

**Formal Definition**

```
For each incident or near-miss: identify which metrics would have detected it. Coverage Gap = |incidents_undetected_by_taxonomy| / |total_incidents|. Drives taxonomy evolution: gaps indicate new metrics needed.
```

**Limitations**

> Requires structured incident analysis and taxonomy maintenance process.

**Novel Thinking / Implications**

> 💡 The taxonomy is not static. As AVT evolves and new failure modes emerge, the taxonomy must evolve to cover them. Coverage gap analysis is the mechanism for this evolution — every incident should prompt the question 'would our metrics have caught this?' If not, that's a gap to fill.
