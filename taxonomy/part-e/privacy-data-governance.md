## Privacy & Data Governance

*Audio retention, data minimisation, consent verification, and compliance with UK GDPR and NHSE IG requirements.*

**Tier breakdown**: 🟢 5 Tier 1 · 🟡 1 Tier 2

### 🟢 Audio Retention Compliance

Whether audio recordings are retained, for how long, and whether retention complies with the stated DPIA and privacy notice. Includes monitoring for unauthorised retention beyond stated periods.

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Priority Tier** | 🟢 Tier 1 — Minimum Viable |
| **Measurement Cadence** | Continuous |
| **Pipeline Layer** | Cross-cutting |
| **Assurance Question** | Safety |
| **Measurement Method** | Computational |
| **Lifecycle Phases** | Continuous |
| **Responsible Actors** | Vendor, Deployer |
| **Maturity** | Established |
| **Outcome Type** | Proximal |
| **Source** | UK GDPR Article 5(1)(e) storage limitation; NHSE IG guidance on ambient scribing (March 2026) |

**Why this tier?**

> UK GDPR storage limitation requirement. Non-compliance is a regulatory breach. Deployer must verify vendor retention practices align with DPIA.

**Formal Definition**

```
Compliance rate = |encounters_within_retention_policy| / |total_encounters|. Track: actual deletion timestamps vs policy-required deletion timestamps. Delta > 0 = non-compliant retention. Must verify deletion is genuine (not just flagged), including backup systems.
```

**Limitations**

> Deployers typically cannot verify vendor-side deletion without independent audit. Backup and disaster recovery systems may retain data beyond primary deletion.

**Novel Thinking / Implications**

> 💡 Audio is the most sensitive data AVT processes — it captures everything said in the consultation, including content that doesn't make it into the note. Retention policy must distinguish between audio needed for review-before-signing (minutes) and audio retained for quality improvement or dispute resolution (potentially months). The DPIA must address both.

### 🟡 Data Minimisation Score

Whether the AVT system processes only the minimum data necessary for its function. Includes: does the system transmit full audio to cloud when local processing would suffice? Does it retain intermediate outputs (full transcript) when only the summary is needed?

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Priority Tier** | 🟡 Tier 2 — Recommended |
| **Measurement Cadence** | Periodic audit |
| **Pipeline Layer** | Cross-cutting |
| **Assurance Question** | Safety |
| **Measurement Method** | Hybrid |
| **Lifecycle Phases** | Pre-deployment, Periodic Audit |
| **Responsible Actors** | Vendor, Deployer |
| **Maturity** | Proposed / Novel |
| **Outcome Type** | Proximal |
| **Source** | UK GDPR Article 5(1)(c) data minimisation; DGX Spark / local processing potential |

**Why this tier?**

> UK GDPR data minimisation principle. Periodic architectural review of what data is processed, transmitted, and retained vs what is necessary.

**Formal Definition**

```
DMS = data_necessary / data_processed. Ideal DMS = 1.0. Track per data type: audio, transcript, summary, coded data, metadata. Architecture assessment: local vs cloud processing; data transmitted vs data retained; intermediate outputs vs final outputs.
```

**Limitations**

> Defining 'necessary' is contested — vendors argue cloud processing is necessary for quality; privacy advocates argue local processing is sufficient for many use cases.

**Novel Thinking / Implications**

> 💡 The DGX Spark and similar edge AI hardware create a genuine architectural choice: local processing minimises data exposure but may limit model capability. The data minimisation score should drive architectural decisions — if local processing meets quality thresholds, cloud transmission of full audio is unnecessary and non-compliant with minimisation principles.

### 🟢 Consent Verification Accuracy

Whether patients are actually informed about AVT use as required by CQC Mythbuster 109 (implied consent is sufficient, but patients must be informed). Measures both process compliance and patient understanding.

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Priority Tier** | 🟢 Tier 1 — Minimum Viable |
| **Measurement Cadence** | Continuous |
| **Pipeline Layer** | Cross-cutting |
| **Assurance Question** | Patient Experience |
| **Measurement Method** | Hybrid |
| **Lifecycle Phases** | Continuous, Periodic Audit |
| **Responsible Actors** | Deployer |
| **Maturity** | Proposed / Novel |
| **Outcome Type** | Distal |
| **Source** | CQC Mythbuster 109; NHSE IG guidance; common law implied consent requirements |

**Why this tier?**

> CQC Mythbuster 109 requires patients to be informed. Process compliance is measurable today. Understanding gap is harder but periodic survey is feasible.

**Formal Definition**

```
Process compliance = |consultations_where_patient_informed| / |total_AVT_consultations|. Understanding rate = |patients_who_can_describe_AVT_use| / |patients_surveyed| (periodic audit). Gap = process_compliance - understanding_rate reveals 'informed but not understanding' problem.
```

**Limitations**

> Process compliance is measurable; patient understanding is not easily quantified. Self-report may overstate understanding. Cultural and language barriers affect both notification and comprehension.

**Novel Thinking / Implications**

> 💡 The gap between 'informed' and 'understanding' is the critical measure. A practice achieving 100% process compliance (every patient is told) may still have 30% understanding (patients don't grasp what AVT does with their speech). The consent model's legitimacy depends on understanding, not just notification.

### 🟢 Cross-Border Data Transfer Compliance

Does AVT processing involve data transfer outside UK/EU? UK GDPR Article 46 requires appropriate safeguards for international transfers. Cloud-hosted AVT vendors may process data in US or other jurisdictions.

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Priority Tier** | 🟢 Tier 1 — Minimum Viable |
| **Measurement Cadence** | One-off gate |
| **Pipeline Layer** | Cross-cutting |
| **Assurance Question** | Safety |
| **Measurement Method** | Human Review |
| **Lifecycle Phases** | Pre-deployment, Periodic Audit |
| **Responsible Actors** | Vendor, Deployer |
| **Maturity** | Established |
| **Outcome Type** | Proximal |
| **Source** | UK GDPR Article 46; Schrems II implications |

**Why this tier?**

> Legal compliance requirement. Must be assessed at procurement. Non-compliance is a regulatory breach.

**Formal Definition**

```
Audit data flow: (1) Where is audio processed? (2) Where are model inferences performed? (3) Where is data stored? (4) Where do support staff access data? For each non-UK location, verify Article 46 safeguards (SCCs, adequacy decisions, BCRs).
```

**References**

- **UK GDPR**: UK GDPR Article 46 — appropriate safeguards for international transfers

**Limitations**

> Vendor data flow transparency varies. Sub-processors may transfer data without main vendor visibility.

**Novel Thinking / Implications**

> 💡 Cloud-hosted AVT often involves transfers to US-based hyperscaler infrastructure. The Schrems II ruling complicates US transfers significantly. Many AVT vendors don't fully document their data flows — a compliance gap that becomes a deployer liability under UK GDPR.

### 🟢 Subject Access Request Fulfilment

Can the deployer fulfil patient SAR requests for AVT-related data within statutory timeframes (one calendar month under UK GDPR)? Includes audio if retained, transcripts, intermediate outputs, and the final note.

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Priority Tier** | 🟢 Tier 1 — Minimum Viable |
| **Measurement Cadence** | One-off gate |
| **Pipeline Layer** | Cross-cutting |
| **Assurance Question** | Safety |
| **Measurement Method** | Human Review |
| **Lifecycle Phases** | Pre-deployment, Continuous |
| **Responsible Actors** | Vendor, Deployer |
| **Maturity** | Established |
| **Outcome Type** | Proximal |
| **Source** | UK GDPR Article 15 right of access |

**Why this tier?**

> Legal compliance requirement. Must be tested before go-live to confirm vendor supports SAR fulfilment workflow.

**Formal Definition**

```
SAR Fulfilment Rate = |SARs_completed_within_30_days| / |total_SARs|. Sub-criteria: (1) Can deployer locate all AVT data for a patient? (2) Can it be exported in usable format? (3) Within statutory timeframe? Target: 100% within 30 days.
```

**Limitations**

> Requires deployer to know what AVT data exists and how to retrieve it from vendor systems. Many current AVT integrations don't provide patient-level data export.

**Novel Thinking / Implications**

> 💡 When a patient submits a SAR, the deployer must provide all personal data including AVT-generated material and any retained audio. If the vendor doesn't provide patient-level export, the deployer cannot fulfil their statutory obligation. This should be a procurement question, not discovered after the first SAR.

### 🟢 Right to Erasure Compliance

If a patient requests erasure under UK GDPR Article 17, can audio, transcripts, and intermediate outputs actually be deleted? Backup systems, vendor caches, and downstream secondary uses complicate this.

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Priority Tier** | 🟢 Tier 1 — Minimum Viable |
| **Measurement Cadence** | One-off gate |
| **Pipeline Layer** | Cross-cutting |
| **Assurance Question** | Safety |
| **Measurement Method** | Human Review |
| **Lifecycle Phases** | Pre-deployment |
| **Responsible Actors** | Vendor, Deployer |
| **Maturity** | Emerging |
| **Outcome Type** | Proximal |
| **Source** | UK GDPR Article 17 right to erasure |

**Why this tier?**

> Legal compliance requirement. Must be tested before go-live to understand erasure scope and limitations.

**Formal Definition**

```
Erasure Test: process a synthetic erasure request through the system. Verify deletion in: primary storage, backups, vendor caches, model training pipelines, downstream secondary use. Verification Rate = locations confirmed deleted / total locations.
```

**Limitations**

> True deletion is technically difficult. Backup systems retain data. Model training data may be impossible to remove from trained models.

**Novel Thinking / Implications**

> 💡 The hard case: if audio from a patient was used to fine-tune the vendor's model, can that influence be removed? Probably not — and this should be disclosed in the privacy notice. Patients should know that consenting to AVT may include effectively irreversible inclusion of their voice in model training. This is a transparency obligation that current AVT consent processes rarely address.
